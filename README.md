# PR-Network-Anomaly-Detection
Problem StatementThe exponential growth of network traffic has led to an increase in networkanomalies, such as cyber attacks, network failures, and hardware malfunctions.Network anomaly detection is a critical task for maintaining the security andstability  of  computer  networks.   The  objective  of  this  assignment  is  to  helpstudents understand how K-Means and Normalized Cut algorithms can be usedfor network anomaly detection.

1  Download Datset and Understand the Format

2  Clustering Using K-Means and Normalized Cut (Yourimplementation)
3  Normalized Cut (Your implementation)

4  EvaluationWe  will  evaluate  models  based  on  their  ability  to  detect  network  anomaliesaccurately.  You will be required to use the following metrics to evaluate thequality of their models:•Precision•Recall•F1 score•Conditional Entropy

5  New Clustering Algorithm (Your implementation)
Your goal is to get to know to other clustering techniques and how they areworking and differ than K-Means and Normalized cut.  Choose any clusteringtechnique of your own choice, implement it and repeat the above experiments.
